# Architecture Decision Record - Choose CSS Framework

## Title
Choose CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS /w DaisyUI vs. Bootstrap vs. Material-UI

## Status
Accepted

## Context
For rapid development we should use a css framework. For consistent styling we should use a component library.

## Decision
After careful consideration of our project's needs, including development timeline, desired aesthetic, and team expertise, we have decided to go with TailwindCSS /w DaisyUI. This choice is influenced by it not being too opiniated but still providing consistent styling. Also tailwind css is not too far from regular css, so the learning curve is relatively small.

## Consequences
Choosing TailwindCSS /w DaisyUI leads to several consequences:

- **Ease of Development**: [While tailwindcss has a bit steeper learning curve than regular css, considering the different levels of css knowledge in our group some of us had to learn either one anyway.]

- **Design Consistency**: [For design consistency DaisyUI helps us with styling that's not too opiniated so both consistency and configureabilty are pro's]

- **Responsiveness and Compatibility**: [While not an objective on it's own tailwindcss provides styling based on screen size and is viable for responsive design]

- **Learning Curve and Documentation**: [TailwindCSS's documentation is thorough and provides enough information to resolve any issues. DaisyUI is a plug and play library you can take what you need and configure it to your liking.]

- **Customization and Scalability**: [TailwindCSS is a tried an true css framework.]

- **Community and Support**: [Since TailwindCSS is one of the most popular css frameworks there are plenty of resources to learn from]
